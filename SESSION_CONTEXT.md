# AWS Cost Optimizer - Session Context for New Claude Instance

## Current Issue: Organizations Detection 500 Error

### Problem Summary
- Organizations detection endpoint returning 500 error
- CloudWatch logs are now available (wasn't reaching Lambda before)
- Lambda functions likely need code deployment update

### Technical Details
1. **Frontend Call**: `POST /organizations/detect`
2. **Expected Handler**: `handlers/organizations.handler`
3. **Recent Changes Made**:
   - Added CORS headers to all error responses in organizations.ts
   - Fixed route matching for API Gateway v2 format
   - Added OPTIONS preflight handling
   - Fixed property name mismatches (awsAccountId vs accountId)

### Files Modified in Previous Session
1. `/backend/src/handlers/organizations.ts` - Added CORS, fixed routing
2. `/frontend/src/components/OrganizationManagement.tsx` - Fixed property names
3. `/frontend/src/components/Icons.tsx` - Added UserIcon, removed duplicate FolderIcon
4. `/frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` - Added delete functionality, org badges
5. `/frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx` - Added auth redirect
6. `/frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` - Added Dashboard button when authenticated
7. `/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added isAuthenticated property
8. `/infrastructure/terraform/api_gateway.tf` - Added DELETE /accounts/{accountId} route

### Deployment Status
- ✅ Frontend built successfully
- ✅ Backend built successfully  
- ✅ Lambda ZIP created: `lambda_function.zip` (27MB)
- ❌ Lambda functions NOT updated (need `terraform apply`)
- ✅ API Gateway routes updated via Terraform

### To Fix the 500 Error
1. Run `terraform apply` to update all Lambda functions with new code
2. Check CloudWatch logs for specific error
3. Verify organizations Lambda has correct permissions

## Multi-Organization Architecture Decision Needed

### The Challenge
- AWS allows only ONE organization per AWS account (1:1 relationship)
- Customers may manage MULTIPLE organizations
- Need architecture to support this use case

### Options Considered
1. **Account-Based Separation** (Current approach)
   - Each connected account = one organization
   - Simple, clean separation
   - Customer switches between accounts in UI

2. **Unified Dashboard** (Recommended evolution)
   - Organization switcher/dropdown
   - Aggregate view across all organizations
   - Better UX for multi-org customers

3. **Workspace Model** (Most complex)
   - Create logical workspaces
   - Group by business unit, not AWS structure
   - Most flexible but complex

## Other Completed Features
1. ✅ Organization Management UI with StackSet deployment
2. ✅ Authentication improvements (auto-redirect, Dashboard button)
3. ✅ Account deletion with confirmation dialog
4. ✅ Organization account checkbox in CloudFormation onboarding

## Next Steps for New Session
1. Deploy Lambda functions with `terraform apply`
2. Debug organization detection error from CloudWatch
3. Decide on multi-organization architecture
4. Test full organization onboarding flow
5. Implement multi-account analysis aggregation

## Key API Endpoints
- `POST /organizations/detect` - Detect AWS Organization
- `POST /organizations/deploy` - Deploy StackSet
- `GET /organizations/{organizationId}/status` - Check deployment status
- `DELETE /accounts/{accountId}` - Delete account (new)

## Environment
- **API URL**: https://11opiiigu9.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev
- **Region**: eu-west-2
- **Tables**: accounts, analyses, organizations, organization_accounts
- **Lambda Runtime**: nodejs22.x
