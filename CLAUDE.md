Each Lambda is now individually packaged with only its required dependencies, reducing package sizes by 82-93% compared to the previous monolithic 54MB deployment.

## Key Components

### Analysis Engine (`/backend/src/handlers/analysis.ts`)
**Primary analysis handler supporting both GET (fetch previous) and POST (run new) requests**

Key functions:
- `getLatestAnalysis()` - Fetches previous analysis results from DynamoDB
- `analyzeUnattachedVolumes()` - Detects unused EBS volumes
- `analyzeEC2Instances()` - EC2 rightsizing with CloudWatch metrics
- `analyzeS3Storage()` - Storage class optimization recommendations
- `analyzeUnusedElasticIPs()` - Enhanced IP detection with comprehensive logging
- `analyzeLoadBalancers()` - ALB/NLB/Classic load balancer analysis

### Dashboard (`/frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`)
**Enterprise-grade multi-panel application with:**
- Sophisticated sidebar navigation system
- Multi-view architecture (Overview, Accounts, Analysis, Recommendations, Reports, Settings)
- Real-time metrics cards with professional SVG icons
- Analysis result persistence (loads previous results on refresh)
- Cache indicators and "Run Fresh Analysis" functionality
- Interactive cost breakdown and savings impact charts
- Comprehensive dark mode with smooth transitions
- Professional theming throughout all components
- Account onboarding integration

### CloudFormation Onboarding (`/frontend/src/components/CloudFormationOnboarding.tsx`)
**3-step wizard for frictionless AWS account connection:**
1. **Region Selection** - Visual confirmation with deploy readiness
2. **One-Click Deploy** - Direct AWS Console integration with session preservation
3. **Role Configuration** - External ID setup and connection validation

## Current Status

## Development Environment

### Local Development
```bash
# Frontend  
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev         # Vite development server

# Lambda Functions
cd infrastructure/lambdas
npm run install:all  # Install dependencies for all Lambdas
npm run build:all    # Build all Lambda packages

# Individual Lambda development
cd infrastructure/lambdas/auth
npm install
npm run package     # Build and create deployment package

# Infrastructure
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform plan      # Review changes
terraform apply     # Deploy to AWS
```

### Lambda Development Workflow
1. **Edit Lambda code**: Modify TypeScript files in `infrastructure/lambdas/{function}/src/`
2. **Build the Lambda**: Run `npm run package` in the Lambda directory
3. **Deploy**: Run `terraform apply` from `infrastructure/terraform/`
4. **Build all Lambdas**: Run `npm run build:all` from `infrastructure/lambdas/`
5. **Note**: Each Lambda has its own package with minimal dependencies for optimal performance

### Important Development Notes
- **Terraform Deployments**: The user will ALWAYS run `terraform apply` commands manually. Never run terraform apply automatically - only prepare the changes and inform the user when they need to deploy.
- **Lambda Architecture**: Each Lambda function is individually packaged with only its required dependencies, significantly reducing cold start times and deployment sizes.
- **Lambda Package Management**: Let Terraform manage Lambda deployment packages. Do NOT manually create zip files for deployment. Manual zipping causes issues with Terraform change detection. If Lambda code changes aren't being detected by Terraform, use: `terraform apply -replace="aws_lambda_function.main[\"function_name\"]"`

### Environment Variables
- `JWT_SECRET_NAME` - AWS Secrets Manager secret name
- `ACCOUNTS_TABLE` - DynamoDB table for user accounts
- `ANALYSES_TABLE` - DynamoDB table for analysis results
- `REGION` - AWS deployment region (eu-west-2)

### Key Dependencies
**Backend:**
- `@aws-sdk/*` - AWS service clients (EC2, S3, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, etc.)
- `bcryptjs` - Password hashing
- `jsonwebtoken` - JWT authentication
- `uuid` - Unique ID generation

**Frontend:**
- `react` + `typescript` - Core framework
- `tailwindcss` - Styling framework with dark mode support
- `recharts` - Chart components for analytics
- Custom SVG icon library - Professional iconography system
- React Context API - Theme and authentication management

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /auth` - User login/registration

### Account Management  
- `GET /accounts` - List connected AWS accounts
- `POST /accounts` - Add new AWS account

### Analysis
- `GET /analysis/{accountId}` - Fetch previous analysis results
- `POST /analysis` - Run new cost analysis
- `POST /reports` - Generate detailed reports

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **✅ Analysis Persistence** *(RESOLVED)*
   - **Issue**: Analysis results disappeared on dashboard reload
   - **Root Cause**: DynamoDB undefined values + API Gateway v2 routing issues
   - **Fix**: Enhanced data cleaning + proper HTTP method detection
   - **Status**: Fixed in latest deployment

2. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify JWT secret is properly stored in Secrets Manager
   - Check Authorization header format: `Bearer <token>`
   - Confirm token hasn't expired

3. **CloudFormation Deployment Issues**
   - Ensure S3 bucket permissions allow public read access
   - Verify CloudFormation template syntax
   - Check AWS session preservation in target account

### Debugging Tools
- **CloudWatch Logs** - Comprehensive logging in all Lambda functions
- **DynamoDB Console** - Inspect stored analysis results
- **API Gateway Console** - Monitor request/response patterns
- **Browser DevTools** - Frontend error tracking and network inspection

## Recent Achievements (August 17, 2025)

### ✅ Fixed Organization Account Scanning
- **Issue**: 404 error when scanning organization member accounts
- **Root Cause**: Frontend passing AWS account ID instead of internal UUID
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated frontend to use correct `account.id` (UUID) instead of `account.accountId`
  - Fixed organization sync to properly mark accounts with `isOrganization: true`
  - Clarified architecture: Single Lambda in main account assumes roles in member accounts
- **Status**: Fully operational - organization accounts can now be scanned successfully

### ✅ Previous Improvements
- **Enhanced StackSet Deployment** - Deploys to all OUs in batches with API limit handling
- **Persistent Organization View** - Management UI persists after refresh
- **Unified Onboarding Flow** - Single wizard for complete organization setup
- **Enterprise UI** - Sophisticated multi-panel application with dark mode
- **Analysis Persistence** - Results cached and auto-loaded on dashboard refresh
- **One-click CloudFormation** - Frictionless IAM role setup

### Phase 2: Trust & Security
